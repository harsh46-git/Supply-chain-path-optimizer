SupplyChain Path Optimizer is a C-based system built with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to
 enhance supply chain operations. The project integrates inventory management, order processing, supplier tracking, and
 transportation planning, and uses graph-based algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and TSP heuristics on a virtual
 delivery map of 200+ nodes. By leveraging efficient DSA implementations, it optimizes routes to minimize transportation
 costs and improve delivery times, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for logistics efficiency.
